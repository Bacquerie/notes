# PROJECTS
---


Sorted in expected chronological order. Most of them do not link anywhere as I've not worked on
them yet, but I'll try to, at least, add a README, describing what I expect each to do.

This list may vary in function of my current interests, but I'll try to not delete anything, and
only cross out obsolete content.


* **[Haunted House]**. You're a non-deterministic AI agent trapped in a monster-filled house. To 
  escape, you must collect the pieces of a puzzle that will banish the monsters forever.
  ***Topics**: Particle filter localization. Kalman filter tracking. MDP-based planning.*

* **[Cave Exploration]**. Program an autonomous robot to explore a dark, and unknown, cave,
  where several gems were detected, collect them all and get back to the entrance as fast as
  possible. ***Topics**: The kinematic bicycle model. FastSLAM and GraphSLAM.*
