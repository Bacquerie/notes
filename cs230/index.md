# Stanford's CS 230: Deep Learning
---

This page concentrates the material I used to study *Deep Learning*. I based my study mostly on the
public material from [CS 230] and [Deep Learning Specialization], but I am not enrolled in
Stanford's course, nor affiliated to the institution. This is mostly a product of my interest in the
subject.

This page concentrates information about:

- **Exercises**, which are written exercises, homework, worksheets that I used to reinforce my
    understanding of the material

- **Notes**, which present my understanding of the topics. As such, these notes might be inaccurate
    or plain wrong, if it happens that I did not understand something (and I am not aware of that)

- **Programming** exercises, where I implemented all the algorithms I found interesting, whole
    programming projects, and my playground for diverse experiments

**NOTE**: You will probably notice that all subpages of this one are prefixed by **CS 230**. This
is due to current limitations of *just-the-docs*, where some navigation functions are based on page
titles, which, if you have several pages with the same name, may provoke name collisions and
mixed references.
