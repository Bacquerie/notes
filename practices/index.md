# PRACTICES

Below I list these practices (in expected chronological order), where most of them do not link
anywhere as I've not worked on them yet, but I'll try to add a README for each, at least describing
what I expect them to do.

* **[Automated Warehouse Administration]**. N-robot inventory administration of a warehouse. The N
     robots work cooperatively to pick up packages from the racks, given an order, and place them
     in desired conveyor belts.
