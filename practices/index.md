# PRACTICES

Sorted in expected chronological order. Most of them do not link anywhere as I've not worked on
them yet, but I'll try to, at least, add a README, describing what I expect each to do.

This list may vary in function of my current interests, but I'll try to not delete anything, and
only cross out obsolete content.


* **[Rodent Control]**. An agent that tracks mice running in your house and catches them using a
  trap gun. ***Topics**: Linear Kalman filters.*

* **[Automated Warehouse Administration]**. N-robot inventory administration of a warehouse. The N
     robots work cooperatively to pick up packages from the racks, given an order, and place them
     in desired conveyor belts. ***Topics**: Deterministic search (Dijkstra).*

* **[Quoridor AI]**. An agent capable of playing the *Quoridor* board game. ***Topics**: N-player
  real-time Minimax and Expectimax.*

* **[Car Parking as Search]**. An experiment using deterministic search algorithms to solve
  diverse predefined car parking scenarios. ***Topics**: Dijkstra, A\* and heuristics.*

* **[Bayes Net API]**. A programming library for modeling Bayesian networks and computing
   probabilities through various inference algorithms. ***Topics**: Bayes nets.
   Variable elimination and sampling algorithms.*

* **[Rally Racing with Markov Models]**. An experiment using Markov models to drive a rally
  car through diverse courses, analyzing its performance across different learning setups.
  ***Topics**: MDPs, value iteration. Model-free and model-based (classical) reinforcement
  learning.*

* **[Adaptive Cruise Control on Hills]**. A simplistic simulation of a car driving on hills, capable
  of cruise control and adaptive cruise control, even in scenarios with changing or missing leading
  vehicles. ***Topics**:  The kinematic bicycle model. PID control. Extended Kalman filters.*
