# ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROJECTS
---


This repository contains several software and hardware projects I've implemented (am currently
implementing or that I plan to implement) in the last/next few years, through my study of
Artificial Intelligence. As such, they display varying levels of *real-world* fidelity, with my
first projects being simulations based on a lot of (unrealistic) assumptions such as: no friction,
particle kinematics, no uncertainty, etc.

Not all of these projects are meant to be capstone research/industry-level projects (I wonder if
any will be), but most of them are my way to reinforce specific concepts like: *Dijkstra's
algorithm, Markov decision processes, Kalman filters, PID control*, etc. I hope that each of my
projects lists the topics I intend to apply, and also that they get inscreasing scopes as I
progress through my study.

Finally, these projects are divided into two categories:

1. **Practices**: Short programs for which I slotted (in planning, not necessarily in
   implementation) around two weeks and are highly-limited in scope. In my mind these would mimic
   a bi-weekly programming project in a college course.
2. **Projects**: Not so short programs for which I slotted around 3-5 weeks, where I tried to apply
   more than one topic at once. In my mind these would serve as midterm projects or final (not
   gigantic) projects.
