# CS Notes
---

This page contains my work and notes related to the courses of my interest in computer science. It
is currently a work in progress and in constant (but slow) growth. The main purpose of this site
is to serve as a centralized source of information mostly for myself, as I'm planning to study a
Master of Science in Computer Science with an emphasis in Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning,
and I'll have a lot of work to do with both, formal and informal courses I'll take in the following
years.

For now, I only have a bit of content about:

- **[Artificial Intelligence]**, mostly but not exclusively based on *Berkeley's CS 188* public content.
- **[Deep Learning]**, mostly but not exclusively based on *Stanford's CS 230* public content, and its
related Coursera specialization.

But I'm planning to add the product of my study for:

- **Stanford's CS 129** (finished; pending to add to this site)
- **Coursera's Natural Language Processing Specialization** (finished; pending to add to this site)
- Many more when I actually start OMSCS: Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Computer Vision,
Natural Language Processing, Game AI, Artificial Intelligence for Robotics, etc...
